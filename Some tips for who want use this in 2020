There are many differences between tensorflow2.0 and tensorflow1.x, the latter one is uesd by this project, so this means, if you don't modify codes to tensorflow2.0 style, it's better to look at some tips as follows:
1: please download python which version is previous version of 3.8, as i tested, only 3.8 can not use opencv module. 
2: tensorflow2.0 will occured some attributes wrong since this project used tensorflow 1.x, i tried tensorflow1.14.
3: please add 1 line after all of the import :import os
											  os.environ["KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK"] = "TRUE".  because of some reason i don't know, this can avoid some operation system errors.
4: for some complex reason, you can change import tensorflow as tf to import tensorflow.compat.v1 as tf
